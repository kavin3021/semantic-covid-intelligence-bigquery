## Slide 1: Title Slide
**Semantic COVID-19 Intelligence with BigQuery AI**

*Transforming Health Data Analysis with Vector Search & Generative AI*

**Team:** Kavindhiran C
**BigQuery AI Hackathon 2025**
**Date:** September 1st, 2025

## Slide 2: Problem Statement
### The Challenge
- **Traditional keyword search fails** to capture semantic meaning in COVID data
- **Public health researchers struggle** with context-aware data exploration  
- **Manual analysis is time-consuming** and may miss critical patterns
- **Complex datasets require intelligent insights**, not just raw numbers

### The Gap
Current tools can't bridge structured COVID statistics with meaningful, contextual understanding.

---

## Slide 3: Our Solution Overview
### Semantic COVID-19 Intelligence System
**Three-Layer AI Architecture:**

1. **Vector Embeddings** → Convert COVID data into semantic representations
2. **Similarity Search** → Find contextually relevant records using cosine similarity  
3. **Generative AI** → Produce natural language insights and summaries

### Key Innovation
**Beyond keyword matching** → **Understanding meaning and context**

## Slide 4: Technical Architecture
```
COVID Data → Text Embedding → Vector Storage → Similarity Search → AI Generation
     ↓              ↓              ↓              ↓              ↓
BigQuery Tables → Gecko Model → Embeddings → Cosine Similarity → Gemini Pro
```

### BigQuery Components:
- `covid_with_embeddings` - Enhanced data with vectors
- `semantic_search_results` - Similarity search outcomes  
- `ai_covid_summaries_from_search` - AI-generated insights

---

## Slide 5: Live Demo
### Demonstration Flow:
1. **Semantic Search Query** - Find similar COVID records by meaning
2. **Similarity Results** - View top matches with confidence scores
3. **AI-Generated Insights** - Read natural language summaries
4. **Contextual Understanding** - Show how it surpasses keyword search

### Sample Query:
*"Find regions with respiratory complications"*
→ Returns pneumonia, breathing difficulties, lung issues
