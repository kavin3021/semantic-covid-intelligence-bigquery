##  Project Overview

**Semantic COVID-19 Intelligence** transforms traditional health data analysis by combining BigQuery's vector search and generative AI capabilities. This project enables context-aware, intelligent exploration of COVID-19 datasets, moving beyond keyword limitations to understand semantic meaning and generate actionable insights.

###  Core Problem Solved
Traditional keyword search fails to capture semantic relationships in health data. Searching for "respiratory issues" misses records about "pneumonia" or "breathing difficulties" - clearly related concepts that existing systems cannot connect.

###  Our Solution
A three-layer AI architecture that:
1. **Understands meaning** through vector embeddings
2. **Finds similar content** using semantic search  
3. **Generates insights** with natural language AI

    C --> D[Similarity Search]
    D --> E[Gemini Pro AI]
    E --> F[Natural Language Insights]
```

### Core Components
- **Data Layer**: COVID-19 datasets in BigQuery
- **Embedding Layer**: `text_embedding_gecko_model` for semantic vectors
- **Search Layer**: Cosine similarity for finding related records
- **Intelligence Layer**: `gemini_pro_model` for generating insights
